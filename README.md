# DS-Regression

The project applies some regression methods commonly used in the Statistical Learning literature for estimating school dropout in elementary school from the state of Pernambuco. The data involved educational indicators, and phases were defined in the study to understand, prepare, and model the data. For prediction, models were applied for estimating school dropouts using kernel-based and linear regression methods.
